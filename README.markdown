# Git Repo Tools
## Introduction
Git-repo-tools is a collection of tools meant to be used alongside gitosis.  These tools are meant to ease the life of people using gitosis.  There are bugs.  I don't write perfect code.  Log an issue and I will look into it.

## log.py
The log.py only generates data for now.  I want it to also generate graphs.  Perhaps when I have the time I'll add those.

## Post receive hook
This hook is mean to deploy code.  I wanted it to work on rsync, which failed for some reason.  I'm trying to get that to work and I'll update it once fixed.  Am I doing it wrong?  If you think there is a better way, let me know.  Better yet, fork and request merge.
